# Open Source Digital Twin 

## Welcome to Open Source Digital Twin 

We are a group dedicated to developing open source digital twins.

### What Are Digital Twins?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of the physical counterpart, offering insights, predictions, and optimization opportunities.

### Our Projects

Explore our open source digital twin projects:

1. **[Motion control playground](https://github.com/Open-Source-Digital-Twin/motion-control-playground)**: This project is a virtual environment for testing different motion control algorithms. It uses the Bevy game engine and is written in Rust.
2. **[Inverted Pendulum Controller](https://github.com/Open-Source-Digital-Twin/inverted-pendulum-controller)**: An open-source controller for stabilizing inverted pendulum systems, facilitating research and experimentation in control theory and robotics.
