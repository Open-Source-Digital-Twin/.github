# Open Source Digital Twin 

## Welcome to Open Source Digital Twin 

We are a group dedicated to developing open source digital twins.

### What Are Digital Twins?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of the physical counterpart, offering insights, predictions, and optimization opportunities.
